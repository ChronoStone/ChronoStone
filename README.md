### Hi there, I'm Khalid SABIH ðŸ‘‹

I am a 22 year-old Software Engineering student in my final year at the National School of Applied Sciences of Fez (ENSAF). I have recently started my end-of-studies internship as a Software Development Engineer at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Maroc.

Throughout my academic journey at ENSAF, I have managed to develop a strong foundation in the software development field while also refining my teamwork skills, communicative aptitude, and ability to think creatively and I am eager to apply this well-rounded skill set in a thriving professional environment like SGMA. 

### What I'm currently focusing on...

Currently improving my SpringBoot/Angular skills !
