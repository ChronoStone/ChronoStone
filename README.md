### Hi there, I'm Khalid SABIH ðŸ‘‹

I am a 22 year-old Software Engineering student in my final year at the National School of Applied Sciences of Fez (ENSAF). I have recently started my end-of-studies internship as a Software Development Engineer at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale Maroc.

Throughout my academic journey at ENSAF, I have managed to develop a strong foundation in the software development field while also refining my teamwork skills, communicative aptitude, and ability to think creatively and I am eager to apply this well-rounded skill set in a thriving professional environment like SGMA. 

### What I'm focusing on

Currently improving my SpringBoot/Angular skills ! </br>
I am constantly striving to expand my skill set and knowledge, and currently delving into multiple areas of software engineering to broaden my expertise. Some of the fields I'm actively exploring include Cloud Computing, DevOps practices, Containerization, Agile methodologies.
